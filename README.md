# Euchre Tourney App

## Far Future Ideas
* Multipeer connectivity and scoring
    * Users connect to a game, similar to kahoot then enter their scores after each game, app automatically keeps track of a leaderboard
    * Scoring algorithm needs to support uneven amount of games played
* Monolithic scoring, user selects winning team for each table each round, program keeps track of indvididual scores
    * Separate leaderboard tab
